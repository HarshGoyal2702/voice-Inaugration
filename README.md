# 🎤 Voice-Inauguration 🎉

**An interactive voice-controlled web experience for opening ceremonies and events.**  
This project uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create an engaging inauguration where voice commands control various elements like opening a curtain, flipping a card, triggering confetti, and playing a cheer sound.  

## 🚀 Features

- **Voice Command Activation** – Uses the system microphone to recognize and execute predefined commands.
- **Button-Triggered Recognition** – Users must first click the `"Power of V"` button to enable voice commands, preventing background noise interference.
- **Curtain Control** – Say `"Open the curtain"` to reveal the event.
- **Meeting Start with Confetti** – Say `"Start the meeting"` to flip a card, display event details, pop confetti, and play a cheer sound.
- **Interactive Event Card** – Displays event details on the front and judges' names on the back.
- **Personalized Greeting** – Say `"Hi, I am [your_name]"` and receive a custom greeting.
- **Event Explanation** – Ask `"Why are we here?"`, and the system will respond with the event’s purpose.
